Open Format
===========

In this repository you will find the source files of the [bq witbox 3D printer](http://www.bq.com/gb/products/witbox.html) migrated to [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/). This migration is an ongoing work in progress, but if you are missing something specific, please do not hesitate to [file an issue on github](https://github.com/bq/witbox/issues).

Directory structure
===================

There are two folders:

* `native-freecad`: contains the Witbox parts in FreeCAD's native .fcstd format
* `exports`: contains exports of the parts generated from the FreeCAD source files
  * `stl`: Parts exported to STL format
  * `step`: Parts exported to STEP format

Work in progress
================

We are migrating the Witbox parts from Autodesk Inventor to FreeCAD. Currently only a few parts have been migrated. We invite people from the community to join us and help us to complete the task.
