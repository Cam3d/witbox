STEP files generated from Autodesk Inventor 2015
================================================

There are some problems when importing the Witbox-assembly-original_v04.stp file into the current FreeCAD 0.14.

You can find the latest STEP files compatible with FreeCAD at `../../freecad`. There you can also find the sources that have already been converted to FreeCAD.
