Directory structure
====================

This folder is where the migration of the witbox design will be migrated to an open format
(using the Freecad tool, stable version 0.14)

* The step and stl are temporary folders were the step an stl files generated with freecad will be stored.  In the future, when the migration is completed, these files will be stored in the main folder (but at the moment, they will be separated from the original files until is double checked that they are exactly as the originals)

* Witbox-assembly-init:  Witbox assembly 3D file with the original step parts imported in freecad. There are some problems importing the original step file in Freecad. This file works ok but it takes some time to open (there are only two parts missing: the z coupling and the z worm screw. For unknow reasons freecad was not able to import them).
