Directory structure
===================

 * `autodesk-inventor`: The original Witbox source files for Autodesk Inventor(tm) and the exported step file. This folder is frozen. Find the latest version in the `freecad` folder

 * `freecad`: Witbox source files in [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/). This is a work in progress. All the original files are being migrated to Freecad (see below)

 * `Witbox-BOM.ods`: Witbox Bill of Materials. Document for [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).

**Please note**: The original Witbox design was made in Autodesk Inventor(tm) which is proprietary software. Since we love open formats we are migrating the Witbox parts to [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/), which is a multiplatform open source CAD software. We invite people from the community to join us and help us to complete the task.
