Towards an Open Format
=======================
The original witbox design was made in Autodesk Inventor(tm).  The problem is that the source files are in a propietary format. Only the people with access to this tool will be able to open and/or modify the files.

  In order to make it accesible to more people, it would be needed to have the source files in open formats. Currently there are two main open 3D tools (Free software): openscad and Freecad. Our goal is to migrated the witbox design from inventor to Freecad. Once finished, everyone will be able to download and install Freecad, open the witbox design, study it and modify it
